I don't know the google course is a little boring and the interactive bits are
kinda weird and wonky. I'm gonna try fastai.

I should be signing and reading my new legal docs but screw it ML is more
interesting.

This book is interesting enough, I like that it's all in a notebook, but they
distinctly recommend against using local machines and yet I'm having a lot of
trouble with paperspace gradient. I am considering paying the 8 a month but I'm
just not sure it's worth it?

Well, I went ahead and paid. I paid $8 a month, and now I'm running it on a
beefed up 0.51/hr instance. but it's 6:12 and I'm halfway through Ch. 1 and I'm
gonna log off
